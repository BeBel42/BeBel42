- :school: My name is Martin Lefèvre. I am a student in computer sience at the [[(https://launch.s19.be/)][19 Coding School]]. This school is part of the 42 network.
- ❤️ I love math and programming (the fun part of those, not the boring math or whatever we learn at school).
- :flags: I can speak fluently in French and in English, though I am slowly learning Spanish ^^'
- :computer: I can write code in many languages, such as C, C++, Bash, GLSL, etc.
- :penguin: I love using Linux operating systems, it's just so fun! (I use Arch btw).
- 🐉 I like dragons and ponies, they're just so cute!
